## notes

you need `amongus.png` next to the src file (`screensaver.py`) or exe file (`screensaver.exe`) for it to work

you can make it full screen, but once you change the size again, it'll get stuck (just re run again)

## how to use

go to `./bin`

run `screensaver.exe`

keep the other files :)

## OR

extract `./among-us-screen-saver.zip`

run `screensaver.exe` with the other files

very crazy indeed
